**Title:** MCP SSH4Agent v3.1.0 - Comprehensive SSH automation with 92% context reduction

**Body:**

I've been working on MCP SSH4Agent, a Model Context Protocol server that brings comprehensive SSH management to Claude Code (and OpenAI Codex).

**What is it?**

A complete DevOps automation platform with 37 MCP tools for managing remote SSH servers directly from Claude Code:

- 🔧 Core SSH operations (execute, upload, download, sync)
- 💾 Backup & restore (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, files)
- 🏥 Health monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, network, services)
- 🗄️ Database management (dumps, imports, queries)
- 🚇 SSH tunnels (local, remote, SOCKS)
- 📦 Advanced features (persistent sessions, server groups, profiles, hooks)

**What's new in v3.1.0?**

Tool activation system - reduce context usage by **92%**!

- Enable only the tools you need (minimal mode: 5 tools vs all 37)
- 6 tool groups: Core, Sessions, Monitoring, Backup, Database, Advanced
- CLI: `ssh4agent tools configure` for interactive setup
- Export auto-approval configs for Claude Code

**Why build this?**

Existing MCP SSH tools offer 2-4 basic operations. I needed enterprise DevOps features: automated backups, health monitoring, database operations, etc.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install -g mcp-ssh4agent
```

**Configuration:**

Claude Code:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh4agent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-ssh4agent/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

OpenAI Codex:
```bash
ssh4agent codex setup
```

- NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-ssh4agent
- Glama.ai: https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@jaredshuai/mcp-ssh4agent
- Documentation: Full guides for all features

**Features I'm proud of:**

- Dual compatibility (Claude Code + OpenAI Codex)
- Profile system (default, docker, frappe, nodejs)
- Hooks for automation (pre-deploy, post-deploy, on-error)
- Command aliases (reduce typing)
- Comprehensive testing & CI/CD
- 92% context reduction with tool activation

Would love feedback! Star on GitHub if you find it useful ⭐

## Hacker News Post (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: MCP SSH4Agent – 37 DevOps tools for Claude Code with 92% context reduction

**Body:**

Hi HN! I built MCP SSH4Agent, a comprehensive Model Context Protocol server for SSH automation with Claude Code and OpenAI Codex.

**The problem:** Existing MCP SSH tools offer 2-4 basic operations (execute, upload, download). I needed enterprise DevOps features like automated backups, health monitoring, and database management - directly accessible from my AI assistant.

**What I built:**

37 MCP tools organized into 6 groups:
- Core (5): SSH execute, upload, download, sync, sudo
- Sessions (4): Persistent SSH sessions
- Monitoring (6): Health checks, service status, process management
- Backup (4): MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB/file backups with scheduling
- Database (4): Dumps, imports, queries, table listings
- Advanced (14): Tunnels, groups, profiles, hooks, aliases

**New in v3.1.0: Tool Activation System**

The biggest challenge was context usage - 37 tools consume ~43.5k tokens. Solution: intelligent tool activation.

- Users can enable only needed tool groups
- Minimal mode: 5 tools (~3.5k tokens) = 92% reduction
- Interactive CLI: `ssh4agent tools configure`
- Export auto-approval configs for Claude Code

**Technical details:**

- Built with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk + ssh2
- Dual config support: .env (Claude) + TOML (Codex)
- Profile system for different workflows (docker, nodejs, frappe)
- Hooks for automation (pre-deploy, post-deploy, on-error)
- Comprehensive testing with GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Stack:**

- Node.js 18+
- SSH2 for connections
- Zod for validation
- TOML parser for Codex configs

**Example use cases:**

1. "Deploy my app to production server, create a database backup first"
2. "Check health of all my servers and alert me if any are above 80% CPU"
3. "Execute this command on all servers in the 'web' group sequentially"
4. "Create a backup of the MySQL database and schedule it to run daily at 2am"

Would love HN's feedback! What other DevOps automation would you want accessible from your AI assistant?

## LinkedIn Post

🚀 Excited to announce MCP SSH4Agent v3.1.0!

After months of development, I'm releasing a comprehensive Model Context Protocol server that brings enterprise DevOps automation to Claude Code and OpenAI Codex.

**What does it do?**

Think of it as giving your AI assistant direct, controlled access to your SSH servers with 37 specialized tools:

✅ Execute commands remotely
✅ Automated database backups (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
✅ Health monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, network)
✅ File transfers & synchronization
✅ SSH tunnel management
✅ Database operations
✅ And much more...

**Key innovation in v3.1.0:**

Tool activation system reduces AI context usage by 92%. Enable only the tools you need - from 5 core tools to all 37 advanced features.

**Why this matters:**

DevOps teams spend hours on repetitive SSH tasks. With MCP SSH4Agent, you can ask Claude Code:

"Deploy the app to production, backup the database first, and monitor the health metrics"

And it handles everything - safely and automatically.

**Enterprise-ready features:**

- Profile system for different workflows
- Automation hooks (pre-deploy, post-deploy, on-error)
- Server groups for batch operations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security-first design
