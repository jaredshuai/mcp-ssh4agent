# Changelog

All notable changes to MCP SSH4Agent will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

- **BREAKING — full rebrand from `ssh-manager` / `mcp-ssh-manager` to `ssh4agent` / `mcp-ssh4agent`.** Bin commands are now `ssh4agent` and `mcp-ssh4agent`; the MCP server registers as `ssh4agent` (re-add it in your agent — auto-approval patterns become `mcp__ssh4agent__*`); the config directory is `~/.ssh4agent` (existing `~/.ssh-manager` keeps loading until the new directory exists); `SSH_MANAGER_*` env vars are now `SSH4AGENT_*`; the log file is `.ssh4agent.log`. Remote-side paths changed with **no migration** (the package had no published release): alert configs live at `/etc/ssh4agent-alerts.json`, backups under `/var/backups/ssh4agent`, scheduled scripts at `/usr/local/bin/ssh4agent-backup-*` — re-run `ssh_alert_setup` and `ssh_backup_schedule` on hosts configured with earlier code.
- **BREAKING (contributors) — the codebase is now TypeScript, run natively by Node's type stripping.** All `src/`, `cli/`, `scripts/`, `debug/` modules are `.ts` with explicit `.ts` import extensions (erasable syntax only — no enums/namespaces/parameter properties); there is no tsx and no build step: `node src/index.ts` is the whole dev runtime, and `node --check`/`npm run typecheck` gate it in CI. The dev tree needs Node ≥ 23.6 (type stripping). Exception for publishing only: the npm artifact is compiled to JS under `dist/` by `prepack` (Node refuses type stripping under `node_modules`), so consumers need Node ≥ 20.
- **BREAKING (contributors) — Lint/format tooling is Biome, replacing ESLint + Prettier.** `biome check` gates pre-commit and CI; `npm run lint:fix` is the one-command fixer.
- **The tool registration funnel owns Policy, Audit, and the response envelope.** Every tool handler now declares its policy at registration (`gate: 'server'` by default, with `commandArg`/`serverFrom`/`when` variants, and explicit `gate: 'exempt' | 'manual'` for the two deliberate exemptions) instead of hand-weaving `applyServerPolicy + auditOk` in 15 places: a newly registered mutating tool can no longer skip the per-server policy, and audit entries are written on **both** the success and failure paths — failure is derived from the `isError` flag *or* a thrown error, fixing 29 catch blocks that omitted `isError` and were audited as successes. Tool modules receive their infrastructure via a `ToolContext` (ADR-0002) and never import the entry point.
- **Tunnels own their dedicated connection; shutdown closes tunnels first.** A tunnel no longer borrows a pooled connection it cannot account for — it holds its own, disposes it on close, and `ssh_tunnel_create` now refuses `proxyJump`/`proxyCommand` explicitly (it silently ignored them before) (ADR-0003).
- **One tool-enablement owner for CLI and server.** `src/tool-config-manager.ts` (logger-free, pure fs + registry data) is the single source for tool groups, modes, and per-tool overrides; the CLI's drifted third copy of the list and its four observable behaviour gaps (mode transitions silently enabling all 37 tools, reset resurrecting legacy configs, dead per-tool overrides under `all`, hardcoded export-claude list) are gone (ADR-0004).
- **One config-reading path for CLI and MCP entry point.** `src/env-path.ts` is the single `.env` fallback chain (`SSH_ENV_PATH` → `SSH4AGENT_ENV` (deprecated alias) → `~/.ssh4agent/.env` → legacy → `$PWD/.env` → `~/.env` → package root → default); server reads go through the shared `parseEnvServersText` parser; the CLI's five copies of server→ssh-argument resolution collapsed into `resolveServerToSshArgs()`. The two processes can no longer disagree about which file holds the servers.
- **Centralized shell quoting and dump/import command builders.** Every password/path interpolated into a remote command goes through `src/shell-quote.ts`; the three drifted dump implementations (one of them unquoted — password injection) merged into `src/dump-command-builder.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Failed dump producers can no longer masquerade as successful backups** — `mysqldump … | gzip > out` reported the pipe's *last* exit code, so a wrong password, missing database, or full disk left an empty/partial archive marked as success. Dumps are now two-step (dump to a temp file gated by `&&`, then compress, with a cleanup arm removing both half-products) — pure POSIX, valid under any remote login shell including BusyBox ash. Verified against real MySQL 8 / PostgreSQL 16 (Alpine) containers.
- **Corrupt archives can no longer masquerade as successful imports** — the mirror bug: `gunzip -c X | mysql` exited 0 after consuming a truncated stream. Same two-step fix; the plain-input `cat X | mysql` fallback (which reported success for a *missing* file) became a direct `< X` redirection that fails in the shell. Verified against real MySQL / PostgreSQL containers: a truncated `.gz` fails before the client ever runs, leaving zero partial data.
- **MongoDB backup archive paths no longer drift across consumers** — the dump produced `<id>.tar.gz` while the size check, reported location, and restore all looked for `<id>.gz`. The path now has one source (`mongoArchivePath` / `getBackupArchivePath`), the restore verifies the archive exists before touching the target, and pre-existing `.tar.gz` backups that were never referenced became restorable. `ssh_db_dump` reports the actual archive path for mongodb.
- **All user state now lives under `~/.ssh4agent/`** — the active-profile pointer (`.ssh4agent-profile`, plus the pre-rebrand `.ssh-manager-profile`) was the last state file written to the install directory, which is read-only under a global npm install; every state file now routes through `src/state-files.ts` with one-time best-effort migration from the old location and 0600/0700 permission tightening on every read/write.
- **Aliases can no longer bypass per-server policy** — server resolution went through two paths and only one applied the security modes; there is now a single `resolveServer()` path for everyone.
- **Audit entries no longer leak database credentials** and failure reporting no longer marks errored calls as successes.
- **Connection pool hardening** — in-flight connects are shared instead of racing, failed setups dispose the SSH client before rethrowing, ProxyJump dialing is alias-aware, connect timeouts are wired, and shutdown no longer races live remote forwards.
- **`ssh4agent codex setup` emits a working entry path for installed users** (source vs installed package environments), and the documented-but-missing `codex`, `monitor`, and `session` CLI commands are implemented.

### Added

- **Domain documentation for agents**: `CONTEXT.md` glossary + `docs/adr/` decision records (ToolContext injection, tunnel connection ownership, tool-config single owner, module-split decision for `advanced.ts`).
- **Interface tests without a network**: connection pool, remote tunnels, policy funnel, config unification, tool-config unification, state files, and manager interfaces (session/backup/health) — all driven through fakes at the calling-convention level, where the real bugs used to hide.


## [3.8.0] - 2026-08-14

### Security

- **`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` floor raised to `^1.30.0`** — the declared range (`^1.17.2`) still allowed versions carrying three published advisories, one of them high: cross-client data leak through shared server/transport instance reuse, DNS rebinding protection off by default, and a ReDoS. It also dragged in vulnerable transitive express packages (`body-parser`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, `ajv`). `npm audit --omit=dev` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**. Behaviour verified against the real MCP stdio protocol: identical to 1.17.5 (37 tools registered, same negotiation, clean shutdown).

### Added

- **Optional `group` field on server config** ([#56](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/56) — contributed by [@ice616](https://github.com/ice616), requested in [#55](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/55))
  - A free-form label (`SSH_SERVER_<NAME>_GROUP` in `.env`, `group = "..."` in TOML) carried on the server entry itself, so a server's group membership can be read straight off its config when exporting to — or importing from — another tool, with no second file to ship. It round-trips through `exportToToml`/`exportToEnv` and is returned by `ssh_list_servers`.
  - **The label is not just descriptive: it makes the group usable.** `ssh_execute_group` and `ssh_group_manage list` now resolve members from the `group` field as well, so tagging servers is enough to run a command across them — `.server-groups.json` is no longer required to have a working group.
  - Membership is the **union** of both sources: the explicit list stored by `ssh_group_manage` (which keeps carrying strategy, delay and stop-on-error) plus every server tagged with that name. Group names are case-insensitive. Config-derived members are resolved at read time and never written to `.server-groups.json`, so they cannot go stale.
  - A group that exists only through the config is read-only for `ssh_group_manage`; attempting to edit it now returns an error pointing at the server config instead of a bare "not found".
  - The `ssh-manager` add-server wizard asks for an optional group.
- Tests: new `tests/test-server-groups.js` (14 checks) covers config-derived groups, the union with stored groups, case-insensitivity, read-only enforcement, persistence isolation, the dynamic-group reload regression and group execution; `tests/test-config-field-names.js` gains `group` coverage across the `.env` loader, the TOML loader, the forbidden-field guard and the export round-trip.
- **Static type-checking over the existing JavaScript** (`npm run typecheck`) — a `tsconfig.json` in `checkJs`/`noEmit` mode runs TypeScript as a linter over JSDoc annotations. **Nothing is compiled and nothing changes for users**: the package still ships plain JS straight from `src/`, with no build step and no `dist/`. Added as a hard gate in the Code Quality workflow.
  - A `ServerConfig` typedef in `src/config-loader.js` documents the resolved server shape and makes its camelCase contract enforceable: reading `serverConfig.default_dir` — the exact issue #49 regression — is now a type error (*"Property 'default_dir' does not exist on type 'ServerConfig'. Did you mean 'defaultDir'?"*) instead of a silent `undefined`. `tests/test-config-field-names.js` keeps guarding the same contract at runtime.

### Fixed

- **A tunnel on an already-used local port crashed the entire MCP server** — `net.Server#listen` never passes an error to its callback (a failed bind is emitted as an `'error'` event), yet `ssh_tunnel_create` used `listen(port, host, (err) => ...)` and registered no `'error'` listener. On `EADDRINUSE` — the everyday tunnel failure — Node rethrew the unhandled event and killed the process, taking every pooled SSH connection and session with it, while the awaited promise never settled. Binding now rejects properly and the tool returns an error. Guarded by `tests/test-tunnel-listen.js`.
- **`ssh_sync` always passed an explicit `-p 22` to rsync** — the guard read `serverConfig.port !== '22'`, comparing a number against a string, so it never matched. Harmless in effect, but the intent (omit the flag on the default port) never applied. Found by the new typecheck, along with a matching `parseInt(serverConfig.port || '22')` in `ssh_known_hosts` that only worked because `parseInt` stringifies its argument first.
- **`ssh_sync` treated native Windows local paths as remote rsync specifications** — a path such as `C:\project` was passed unchanged to MSYS2 rsync, which parsed `C:` as a remote host and attempted an SSH connection to `c`. Windows drive-letter, rooted, UNC, and extended-length paths are now resolved and converted only for the spawned rsync argument while Node keeps the native path for local filesystem checks and logging; relative paths keep their existing semantics with normalized separators. Trailing separators retain rsync's directory-content semantics. A path already written in MSYS2 form (`/c/project`, `//server/share`) — the shape Windows users adopted to work around this very bug — is passed through untouched instead of being mounted twice into `/c/c/project`. Guarded by `tests/test-rsync-path.js` (24 checks: conversion table, pass-through, invariants over every input, platform isolation, failure modes, and a static guard on the `ssh_sync` wiring) plus a real MSYS2 rsync dry run.
- **The MCP server announced itself as version `1.2.0`** — the `serverInfo` version sent to Claude Code / Codex was a hardcoded literal the release process never bumped, so it had drifted far behind the real package version (3.7.0). It is now derived from `package.json`, the same treatment the CLI banner got in 3.7.0. This matters more under the MCP `2026-07-28` spec, where servers identify themselves in the `_meta` of every result.
- **`exportToEnv` no longer truncates a `group` containing `#`** — the value is now quoted like `DESCRIPTION`, so a label such as `prod #eu west` survives an export/re-import instead of coming back as `prod`.
- **The dynamic `all` group now sees TOML-defined servers** — it enumerated `process.env` only, so `ssh_execute_group all` silently skipped every server declared in a TOML config. The group layer now reads the configuration actually loaded by `ConfigLoader`.
- **The `all` group no longer disappears after the first group edit** — dynamic groups are deliberately never persisted, so every `.server-groups.json` written by `ssh_group_manage` lacked `all`, and the next start loaded that file as the complete set: `ssh_execute_group all` then failed with `Group 'all' not found`. Dynamic groups are now re-injected when the file is read.

### Changed

- **Dropped the `uuid` dependency** in favour of Node's built-in `crypto.randomUUID()` — available since Node 14.17, and this package already requires Node >= 18. Removes one runtime dependency and the last remaining advisory. Session and tunnel ID formats are unchanged.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Per-server SSH agent forwarding (`ForwardAgent`)** ([#53](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/53) — requested by [@raphaelbahat](https://github.com/raphaelbahat) in [#52](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/52))
  - New opt-in option, `SSH_SERVER_<NAME>_FORWARD_AGENT=true` (`.env`) or `forward_agent = true` (TOML), enabling the equivalent of OpenSSH's `ForwardAgent yes` on a per-server basis. Processes on the remote host can then authenticate to other SSH hosts using the keys held in the operator's local `ssh-agent` (e.g. `git` over SSH), without copying any private key to the server.
  - Requires a running local agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`); the flag is ignored when no agent is present. `ForwardAgent` is set only alongside a valid agent, since `ssh2` throws otherwise. Because `ssh2`'s connection-level `agentForward` forwards on every exec/shell channel, no per-command change is needed.
  - A `parseBool()` helper coerces the `.env` string value so `FORWARD_AGENT=false` is not treated as truthy; only `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` enable it.
  - **Defaults to `false`.** Documented in the README (*SSH Agent Forwarding*) and CLAUDE.md with the standard security warning (a root user on the remote host can use the forwarded agent for the life of the connection).
- Tests: `tests/test-agent-forward.js` verifies the `connect()` wiring across the on/off/absent/no-agent states; `tests/test-config-field-names.js` gains `forwardAgent` coverage including `.env` boolean coercion and a TOML export round-trip.

## [3.6.7] - 2026-07-11

### Security

- **Command injection in the database command builders** ([#51](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/51) — responsibly disclosed by **Ugur Ozer, Aeon AI Risk Management** (http://airiskmanagement.ca), see [#48](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/48))
  - Every `ssh_db_*` tool argument — `database`, `table`, `collection`, output/input file paths, and the `user` / `host` / `port` / `password` connection fields — arrives from tool-call parameters and was interpolated straight into a **shell-evaluated** command string in `src/database-manager.js`. A crafted value (`$(…)`, backticks, `; cmd`, `| cmd`, `&& cmd`, bare `> file`) executed arbitrary commands on the configured SSH target, under the account the MCP server uses.
  - The strongest path is **`ssh_db_list`**: it is classified read-only, so it stayed **allowed in the `readonly` and `restricted`** per-server security modes while still reaching an injectable builder — bypassing the boundary those modes promise.
  - The v3.6.5 heredoc fix (#44) only hardened `ssh_db_query`'s query **text**; the `list` / `dump` / `import` / `restore` builders and the query builders' **connection flags** were untouched.
  - **Fix:** a centralized `shellQuote()` (single-quote wrap + `'\''` escaping) now wraps **every** interpolated caller value across all 15 builders. The MySQL list-tables `database` became a shell-quoted positional argument instead of an interpolated `USE <db>` SQL clause, closing the SQL path too. Shell-quoting is transparent for legitimate values.

### Added

- Security regression test `tests/test-database-injection.js` (`npm run test:dbinjection`, part of `npm test`): drives every builder × every caller-controlled parameter × an injection-payload battery (648 combinations) through a real `/bin/sh` with fake DB client binaries and asserts no payload ever executes; unit-tests `shellQuote()`; verifies benign values stay correctly quoted.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting the private vulnerability disclosure process (GitHub private vulnerability reporting + security email; resolves [#48](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/48)).

## [3.6.6] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Handlers read stale snake_case config fields that `ConfigLoader` no longer produces** ([#49](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/49) — thanks [@egoan82](https://github.com/egoan82) for the excellent root-cause report; fixed in [#50](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/50))
  - Since the v3.0.0 ConfigLoader refactor, resolved server configs expose **camelCase** fields (`sudoPassword`, `defaultDir`, `keyPath`), but several handlers still read the pre-3.0 snake_case/lowercase names — always `undefined`, so their fallback branches silently never ran:
    - `ssh_execute_sudo` ignored the configured `SUDO_PASSWORD` → `sudo: a terminal is required to authenticate` on hosts without a TTY on the exec channel
    - `ssh_execute` / `ssh_group_execute` / `ssh_execute_sudo` ignored `DEFAULT_DIR` — commands silently ran in `$HOME`
    - `ssh_list_servers` always reported an empty `defaultDir`
    - `ssh_sync` never passed the configured SSH key to rsync (`-i` / `BatchMode=yes`), falling back to whatever default key the agent offered
  - No configuration change required: `.env`/TOML source keys (`SUDO_PASSWORD`, `default_dir`, `key_path`, …) are unchanged — existing configs simply start working again.

### Added

- Regression test `tests/test-config-field-names.js` (`npm run test:fieldnames`, part of `npm test`): locks the ConfigLoader's output field names from both `.env` and TOML sources, and statically forbids stale `.sudo_password` / `.default_dir` / `.keypath` access in `src/`.

## [3.6.5] - 2026-06-30

### Security

- **`ssh_db_query` could execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote host** ([#44](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/44) — thanks [@technophile77](https://github.com/technophile77))
  - The query builders interpolated the raw query into a **double-quoted** shell string (`mysql -e "${query}"`, `psql -c "${query}"`, `mongo --eval "${query}"`), so the remote shell evaluated backticks `` `…` `` and `$(…)`/`$VAR` **before** the database engine ever saw the query. The "SELECT-only" tool could therefore run shell commands on the target server (e.g. `` SELECT `id` `` / `SELECT '$(id)'`).
  - The query is now delivered to `mysql`/`psql`/`mongo` on **stdin via a single-quoted heredoc** (`<<'__MCP_SQL_EOF__'`), so the remote shell never parses it — only the database engine interprets the SQL/JS. A shared `buildHeredoc()` helper keeps the existing `awk` JSON-wrapper pipe on the heredoc opening line (MySQL JSON output is byte-for-byte unchanged) and defensively rejects a delimiter collision. `isSafeQuery()` is intentionally left as-is, since the heredoc — not keyword filtering — closes the injection path.

### Fixed

- **`ssh_db_query` (MySQL) silently corrupted backtick-quoted identifiers** ([#44](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/44) — thanks [@technophile77](https://github.com/technophile77))
  - The same shell-evaluation bug meant any query using backtick identifiers — hyphenated database names, cross-database joins, reserved-word columns — was rewritten by the shell and returned empty/incorrect results **with no error**. The stdin heredoc fix above restores these queries verbatim.
- **`ssh_db_query` reported `row_count` off by one** ([#45](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/45) — thanks [@technophile77](https://github.com/technophile77))
  - The handler reported `output.split('\n').length`, which counted cosmetic lines (the leading `[` of the MySQL JSON wrapper, psql header/separator lines) rather than result rows: 1 row → `2`, 13 rows → `14`, 0 rows → `2`. A new `countQueryRows()` derives the count from each engine's actual output structure — MySQL JSON `{"row":N,…}` entries, MySQL `--batch` lines, psql's authoritative `(N rows)` footer (with a header/separator fallback), and MongoDB `printjson` documents — so empty output is `0` and the count tracks real rows.

### Tests

- **New `tests/test-database-query-quoting.js`** (`test:dbquoting`) — verifies the SQL/JS query text is carried verbatim on stdin for all three builders (never via `-e "`/`-c "`/`--eval "`), that the `awk` pipe stays on the heredoc opening line with the terminator alone, that `buildHeredoc` rejects a delimiter collision, and a stochastic round-trip of 500 random shell-metacharacter queries.
- **New `tests/test-database-row-count.js`** (`test:dbrowcount`) — covers the exact issue cases (MySQL 0/1/13 rows), a look-alike `{"row":` value inside a cell, MySQL text format, psql `(N rows)`/`(1 row)`/`(0 rows)` footers and the no-footer fallback, MongoDB single/multi-document counting, and empty/whitespace → `0`.

## [3.6.4] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Internal dead-code cleanup — no behavioral change.** Removed 27 unused exports and 2 duplicate exports across the codebase (−343 lines): fully-unused helper functions deleted, internally-used symbols un-exported, and redundant `export default`s removed. The public surface (the MCP server + CLI) is unchanged — command builders and parsers are byte-identical before/after (verified by a differential test of `main` vs the change), and all 37 tools were exercised end-to-end against a live SSH server (Ubuntu + MariaDB) with no regression.

### Tooling

- **Dead-code quality gate.** Added a calibrated `knip.json` and a **blocking** `knip` step to the `quality` CI workflow, so unused exports/files/dependencies now fail the build and can't creep back in. `eslint src/` is clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).

## [3.6.3] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **`ssh_sync` falsely reported "No files needed to be transferred" even when files were synced** ([#42](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/42) — thanks [@MakksSh](https://github.com/MakksSh))
  - Two bugs in the rsync `--stats` scraper kept `filesTransferred` at `0`: `--stats` was only passed when `verbose` was enabled (so rsync produced no statistics lines at all), and the count regex only matched rsync 2.x wording (`Number of files transferred`) while rsync 3.x — standard on modern distros — emits `Number of regular files transferred`. Agents would mistrust the result, run redundant checks, or retry the sync.
  - `--stats` is now always passed, and the count regex matches both rsync 2.x and 3.x.
- **`totalSize` stayed `0` on macOS, and locale-formatted numbers were mis-parsed** (follow-up hardening)
  - openrsync (the default `/usr/bin/rsync` on recent macOS) suffixes byte counts with `B`, not `bytes`, so the size regex never matched. Both suffixes are now accepted — openrsync keeps raw byte counts even for large files (verified at 5 MB), so no `K/M/G` handling is needed.
  - Numbers grouped with locale-specific separators (`,` or `.` for thousands, the opposite char for the decimal) are now parsed correctly for the file count, transferred size, and speed, instead of only stripping commas.
  - The `--stats` parsing was extracted into `src/rsync-stats.js` so it is unit-testable without booting the MCP server.

### Tests

- **New `tests/test-sync-stats.js`** (wired into `npm test` as `test:sync`) — 46 assertions covering openrsync output captured from a live macOS run, GNU rsync 3.x/2.x, US/EU locale number formats, the zero-files case, and a missing `--stats` block.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **All 37 tool descriptions rewritten for clarity and agent reliability.** Every MCP tool now documents its real behavior — side effects, destructive vs read-only nature, idempotency, sudo/auth requirements, security-mode gating, and parameter semantics (mutually-exclusive params, defaults, edge cases) — instead of a 4-to-10-word summary. Average description length went from ~6 words to ~70, with no weak outliers (shortest is now 55 words).
  - Improves real tool-calling: agents now know the consequences before invoking a tool — e.g. that `ssh_db_import` and `ssh_backup_restore` are destructive (DROP/overwrite), that `ssh_db_query` is strictly SELECT-only, that `ssh_upload`/`ssh_sync`/`ssh_deploy` are blocked on `readonly` servers, and which parameters are mutually exclusive.
  - Also raises the Glama "Tool Definition Quality" score (previously C — average 3.1/5, lowest 2.1/5).
  - **No behavioral change**: only `description` strings were edited; all logic, parameters, and tool names are unchanged. All test suites pass unmodified.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Module-level monitor/cleanup intervals pinned the Node event loop** (follow-up to [#41](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/41))
  - `tunnel-manager.js` (`monitorTunnels`, every 30 s) and `session-manager.js` (inactive-session cleanup, every 5 min) registered module-level `setInterval` timers that were never `unref()`'d, so importing either module kept the event loop alive on its own.
  - Both are now `unref()`'d, matching the keepalive and cleanup timers fixed in #41. The forced-exit added in #41 already made these harmless for the orphan-process bug; this restores proper teardown hygiene so process lifetime tracks the stdio transport, not a background timer.
  - Verified: before, importing either module never exits on its own; after, both exit naturally. Full `npm test` (including `test:lifecycle`) stays green.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Live configuration hot reload** ([#40](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/40) — thanks [@EnjoySR](https://github.com/EnjoySR))
  - The MCP server now reloads its server configuration when the `.env` or TOML file changes on disk, so tools like `ssh_list_servers` see newly added or edited servers **without restarting the MCP process**.
  - A new `ServerConfigManager` tracks a lightweight signature (path + `mtime` + size) of both config files and reloads **lazily** — only when that signature changes, on the next config access. No file watcher, no polling thread, no background timer.
  - **Fail-safe:** if a reload throws (e.g. a malformed file caught mid-edit), the last known-good configuration is kept in memory and the error is logged — the server never ends up with an empty or broken config.
  - `.env` parsing no longer permanently mutates `process.env` (`dotenv` is now read with `processEnv: {}`), and real process environment variables keep the **highest priority** over file values, matching the documented loading order.

### Fixed

- **stdio server orphaned on session teardown — one leaked node process per session** ([#41](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/41) — thanks [@LegendaryGatz](https://github.com/LegendaryGatz))
  - A stdio MCP server is torn down by its host closing **stdin (EOF)** and/or sending **SIGTERM** — not `SIGINT`, which only arrives on an interactive Ctrl-C. The only shutdown handler was `SIGINT`, so on normal teardown the process was never signalled, got reparented to init, and leaked (~83 MB plus live keepalive timers each, accumulating one process per session).
  - Shutdown is now an **idempotent** `shutdown(reason)` registered on `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP` and stdin `'end'`/`'close'`. The per-connection keepalive interval and the 10-minute cleanup interval are `unref()`'d so process lifetime tracks the transport, not a timer. `ssh.dispose()` is wrapped in try/catch so one bad connection can't block the rest, and a short `unref`'d timer forces exit so teardown can never hang if the host has already stopped reading.
  - Measured: exits cleanly **~10 ms** after stdin EOF, versus staying alive indefinitely before.

### Tests

- **New `tests/test-lifecycle.js`** (wired into `npm test` as `test:lifecycle`) — black-box teardown coverage asserting a clean exit on stdin EOF, SIGTERM, SIGINT and overlapping signals. Regression guard for the orphan-process bug.
- **`tests/test-server-config-manager.js` extended to 9 checks** — laziness (no reload while files are unchanged, exactly one reload after a change), reload-failure-keeps-last-valid-config plus recovery, and deleted-file robustness, in addition to the original TOML/`.env` hot-reload paths.

### Backward compatibility

- **Zero impact on existing setups.** Hot reload is transparent — if your config files don't change, behavior is identical to v3.5.x. No new config field, no new prompt, no new file is ever created.
- The lifecycle fix is pure teardown hygiene: no change to any tool's behavior or output.
- All pre-existing test suites pass unmodified.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Healthy Windows/OpenSSH sessions wrongly reported as `Dead`** ([#39](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/39) — thanks @username77)
  - `ssh_connection_status` ran `echo "ping"` and compared the output with a strict `=== 'ping'`. On `cmd.exe` the surrounding quotes are echoed literally (output `"ping"`), so the check failed and a live pooled connection was torn down and rebuilt for nothing.
  - The probe now runs `echo ping` (no quotes), which emits a bare `ping` consistently across bash, `cmd.exe` and PowerShell — fixing the root cause rather than only the symptom.
  - Output parsing moved to a new exported helper `isPingAlive(stdout)` that normalizes CRLF, stray quotes/backslashes and case before matching, and is null/undefined-safe. `includes('ping')` (rather than strict equality) is intentional: a liveness probe should err toward "alive" — a false positive just lets the next real command reconnect, whereas a false negative needlessly drops a healthy connection.
  - **New test suite** `tests/test-ssh-ping.js` (wired into `npm test` as `test:ping`) covering the quoted/escaped/CRLF/case variants and the null/undefined paths. Validated against a real Windows/OpenSSH host.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Per-server security modes** — opt-in second authorization layer that filters tool invocations and commands *inside* the MCP server, complementing the existing client-side `autoApprove` mechanism. Useful when sharing the MCP with a third-party agent, a CI bot, or any context where you can't fully trust the client. See [docs/SECURITY_MODES.md](docs/SECURITY_MODES.md).
  - New per-server fields (env: `SSH_SERVER_<N>_MODE`, `SSH_SERVER_<N>_ALLOW_PATTERNS`, `SSH_SERVER_<N>_DENY_PATTERNS`, `SSH_SERVER_<N>_AUDIT_LOG` — TOML: `mode`, `allow_patterns`, `deny_patterns`, `audit_log`).
  - Three modes: `unrestricted` (default — identical to v3.4.x), `readonly` (blocks mutating tools + built-in destructive command denylist), `restricted` (require regex allowlist + optional denylist, DENY wins over ALLOW).
  - Gated tools: `ssh_execute`, `ssh_execute_sudo`, `ssh_execute_group`, `ssh_session_send` (command-aware), `ssh_upload`, `ssh_sync`, `ssh_deploy`, `ssh_backup_create`, `ssh_backup_restore`, `ssh_backup_schedule`, `ssh_db_import`, `ssh_db_dump` (tool-level), plus action-gated `ssh_key_manage` (accept/remove), `ssh_alert_setup` (set), `ssh_process_manager` (kill).
  - Command aliases (`ssh_command_alias`) are expanded **before** policy evaluation, so the denylist can't be bypassed via an alias.
- **Audit log** — opt-in JSONL trail per server (set `SSH_SERVER_<N>_AUDIT_LOG` to a file path). Records `ts`, `server`, `tool`, sanitized `args`, `allowed`, `reason` (on denial), `exitCode`/`success`/`error` (on execution). Credentials (`password`, `passphrase`, `sudoPassword`, `token`, `secret`, `apikey`) are redacted to `***` even if a tool passes them through args. No log rotation built-in — use `logrotate`.
- **Interactive wizard prompts** (`ssh-manager server add`) for the three new fields, each with default = skip. Pressing Enter on all three produces an `.env` block identical to v3.4.x output.
- **New test suite** `tests/test-policy.js` — 26 tests covering the three modes, DENY > ALLOW precedence, invalid regex handling, secret redaction, fail-closed for unknown modes, backward-compat fast path.

### Backward compatibility

- **Zero impact on existing configs.** A v3.4.x `.env` or TOML file loads identically — no `MODE` field means `unrestricted`, and `evaluatePolicy()` early-returns `{ allowed: true }` without compiling a single regex.
- No new field is mandatory.
- The audit log file is never created unless `AUDIT_LOG` is explicitly set.
- `autoApprove` on the Claude Code side keeps working unchanged — the policy intercepts after the client approves, before the SSH command runs, so the client never sees a new prompt.
- All pre-existing tests (`test-profiles`, `test-command-aliases`, `test-hooks`, `test-tool-registry` — 13 tests) pass without modification.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **SSH handshake failing against OpenSSH 9.x servers (Debian 12 / Ubuntu 24.04)** ([#32](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/32) — thanks @YoungHong1992)
  - The hardcoded algorithm list in `src/ssh-manager.js` was missing modern algorithms required by OpenSSH 9.x. The `ssh2` lib would fail the key-exchange phase against stock Debian 12 / Ubuntu 24.04 servers because no common KEX algorithm could be negotiated.
  - **KEX** — added `curve25519-sha256`, `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org`, `diffie-hellman-group15-sha512`, `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`. `curve25519-sha256` is now OpenSSH's preferred default since 6.5.
  - **Server host key** — added `rsa-sha2-512` and `rsa-sha2-256` (RFC 8332). OpenSSH 8.2+ deprecates the SHA-1-based `ssh-rsa` signature algorithm in the default offer; without SHA-2 variants, RSA host keys could no longer be verified.
  - **Cipher** — added `aes128-gcm@openssh.com` and `aes256-gcm@openssh.com` at the head of the list (preferred GCM variants on modern OpenSSH; the plain `aes*-gcm` names were already present but are not what OpenSSH advertises).
  - **HMAC** — added `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`, `hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com`, `hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com`. Encrypt-then-MAC is both faster and cryptographically stronger than encrypt-and-MAC; OpenSSH prefers ETM variants when both peers support them.
  - **Fully backward-compatible** — every legacy algorithm previously in the list (`diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, `ssh-rsa`, CBC ciphers, plain `hmac-sha*`) is preserved at lower preference. Connections to older servers (CentOS 7, Debian 10, AIX, network gear with legacy SSH stacks) continue to work unchanged.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Full Windows OpenSSH command execution** ([#31](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/31) — thanks @WenKingSu)
  - When a server is configured with `platform = "windows"`, commands are now wrapped as `powershell -NoProfile -OutputFormat Text -EncodedCommand <utf16le-base64>`. This is the same approach used by Ansible, Chef, and Puppet for Windows remote execution. It sidesteps every `cmd.exe` quoting and OEM code page issue (CP950, CP932, CP1252…) that was causing mojibake on non-ASCII output.
  - Prepends `$ProgressPreference='SilentlyContinue'` (suppresses CLIXML progress sentinels in stderr) and `[Console]::OutputEncoding=UTF8` (forces clean UTF-8 stdout).
  - Working-directory prefix uses `Set-Location '${escapedDir}'; ${cmd}` (PowerShell-native, with `'` → `''` escaping) instead of `cd ${dir} && ${cmd}` which is invalid in `cmd.exe`. Applied consistently across `ssh_execute`, `ssh_execute_group`, and `ssh_execute_sudo`.
  - Strictly gated behind `platform === 'windows'` — Linux/macOS targets are completely unaffected.

### Fixed

- **`ssh_session_start` timing out on real-world shells** ([#20](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/20), [#30](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/30) — thanks @MakksSh)
  - The previous shell-prompt detection used a fragile regex (`/[$#>]\s*$/`) that broke on custom prompts, ANSI color codes, multiline prompts, slow shells, `.bashrc`/profile script noise, and any non-standard prompt symbol. Sessions would frequently fail to initialize with `Timeout waiting for shell prompt`.
  - Replaced with a marker-based protocol: the PTY is requested with `ECHO: 0`, a unique UUID v4 readiness marker is sent on session start, and every executed command is wrapped with `set +e; <cmd>; __mcp_status=$?; printf '\n<marker>:%s\n' "$__mcp_status"`. The completion marker carries the **real exit code** captured from `$?` instead of the previous `!output.includes('command not found')` heuristic.
  - A shell prompt is presentation, not a protocol boundary. Marker-based sync is shell-agnostic, deterministic, and requires zero per-server configuration.
  - Bonus: sessions now report accurate `success`/`exitCode` for downstream consumers.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **ProxyCommand support** for SOCKS5 and custom proxy connections ([#24](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/24))
  - New `SSH_SERVER_<NAME>_PROXYCOMMAND` env var (and `proxy_command` in TOML) to specify a custom command (e.g. `ncat --proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 --proxy-type socks5 %h %p`, `ssh -W %h:%p bastion`).
  - Useful for reaching servers behind SOCKS5 proxies, custom jump hosts, or any scenario the existing `ProxyJump` doesn't cover.

### Fixed

- **`ssh_execute` timeout silently capped at 30 s** when the requested timeout was below 300 000 ms ([#28](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/29) — thanks @LukasOrcik for the precise root-cause analysis and @MakksSh for the patch)
  - In `execCommandWithTimeout`, the wrapped `timeout NNN sh -c …` path forwarded `otherOptions` to `ssh.execCommand` without a `timeout` key, so the underlying `SSHManager.execCommand` fell back to its hardcoded 30 000 ms default. The local stream was aborted at 30 s while the remote `timeout` wrapper was still running.
  - Now passes `timeout: timeoutMs + 5000` so the inner timer always exceeds the requested timeout. The +5000 grace lets the remote `timeout` binary return exit code 124/143 first, surfacing the nicer `Command timeout after Nms` message instead of a stream abort.

- **Windows global install fails with `/bin/bash` shim error** ([#22](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/22), [#23](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/23) — confirmed by @Eleef on Win11 / PS7)
  - npm's PowerShell shim refused to launch the legacy bash entry point because Windows has no `/bin/bash.exe`.
  - New cross-platform `cli/ssh-manager.js` Node wrapper is now the `bin.ssh-manager` entry point. On Windows it probes Git Bash → WSL → `bash` on PATH (with proper `C:\…` → `/c/…` and `/mnt/c/…` path conversion); on Unix it just `spawnSync`s `bash`.

- **`server add` blocked at startup by missing `rsync`** ([#22](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/22) follow-up, [#26](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/26))
  - `rsync` was in the **required** dependency list, but it's only used by `ssh-manager sync`. Git for Windows doesn't ship `rsync`, so the CLI was unusable on a stock Windows install for users who never call `sync`.
  - `rsync` is now optional. `cmd_sync` checks lazily and emits an actionable error with install hints for macOS / Debian / Windows (MSYS2 + WSL).

- **`server add` accepted hyphens in server names, producing entries invisible to MCP clients** ([#25](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/25), [#27](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/pull/27) — thanks @alexeibugrov)
  - The Bash CLI used a loose regex when reading `.env` and accepted `web-server`, but POSIX env-var names disallow hyphens. The MCP Node loader uses a strict `/^SSH_SERVER_([A-Z0-9_]+)_HOST$/` and silently dropped the entry, so Claude Code reported zero servers while the CLI listed them.
  - `validate_server_name` now rejects `-` (and any other non-`[A-Za-z0-9_]`) at the prompt, with a copy-paste suggestion (`web-server` → `Try 'web_server' instead`).
  - `server list` detects pre-existing invalid entries, marks each affected row with `⚠ invalid`, and prints a warning block telling the user how to migrate.
  - Prompt examples updated from `web-server` to `web_server` in both `server add` and the interactive wizard.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility**: Replace `process.env.HOME` with `os.homedir()` for cross-platform support ([#8](https://github.com/bvisible/mcp-ssh-manager/issues/8))
  - `process.env.HOME` is undefined on Windows, causing crash at startup
  - Fixed in `src/ssh-key-manager.js`, `src/index.js`, `src/ssh-manager.js`
